  <p>The dataset was built using a fully automated process written in Python. Custom scripts were developed to pull information from multiple sources, ensuring the data could be consistently prepared without the need for manual collection. This makes the system repeatable and adaptable, meaning it could be re-run for both the 2023 and 2024 seasons.</p>

  <p>The Ergast F1 API was the primary source, providing circuit details, race calendars, results, and season standings for both drivers and constructors. To cover gaps in Ergast, qualifying data was gathered from Formula1.com. In addition, Wikipedia pages for each Grand Prix were scraped to extract weather information, which was then cleaned and standardised so that it could be used effectively as a model feature.</p>

  <p>After collection, the datasets were merged into a single structured dataframe containing 172 features. Minimal cleaning was required beyond standardising driver names for identification, as the underlying sources were reliable.</p>

  <p>The machine learning algorithm for predicting Grand Prix results is based on logistic regression. The dataset was split so that all seasons up to 2023 formed the training set, while the 2024 season was used as the test set to evaluate performance. Feature scaling was applied to the training data and then consistently used when transforming the test data to ensure comparability between seasons.</p>

  <p>The model is trained to estimate each driver's probability of winning a race. These probabilities are then used to generate a complete finishing order by ranking drivers from highest to lowest win likelihood, ensuring that each race has a unique predicted outcome. Logistic regression was selected for its balance of simplicity, speed, and interpretability, which makes it well suited for repeated predictions across an entire season.</p>

<div class="about backend">
<h1>Backend</h1>

  <div class="icon-glow"><i class="devicon-flask-original-wordmark" title="Flask"></i></div>
</div>
  <p>The backend is built using Flask, which serves both the web pages and the data routes that power the dynamic parts of the site. All of the machine learning computations are handled entirely on the server side. Predictions for drivers and constructors are generated in Python and then stored as JSON, which Flask pulls whenever the frontend requests it.</p>
  
  <p>There's a single Flask route that bundles together the key datasets (predictions, driver strength, and constructor strength) so the JavaScript on each page can fetch and display them without extra requests. This keeps things simple and efficient.</p>

  <p>The machine learning side makes use of Python's ecosystem of libraries: pandas and NumPy for data handling, scikit-learn for preprocessing and logistic regression, and LightGBM for gradient boosting. Once trained and saved, these models can be reused quickly without having to recompute everything each time.</p>

</div>
  <p>The frontend of this web application is built entirely with custom HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without using any frameworks. The HTML is structured to work with Jinja, which dynamically generates content such as the track carousel, the quickpick bar, and the dropdown menu, as well as individual track pages from a single template.</p>
  <p>The CSS is fully custom too, organised by page and enhanced with media queries at 1500px, 1024px, 768px, 600px and 480px to support a range of devices. Responsiveness has been tested across different screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience.</p>
  <p>The JavaScript is also written from scratch, using helper functions and DOM event listeners to handle interactive features like the carousel, track selection, and metric colour updates. Future improvements may include performance optimisations, and the site's Lighthouse score will be added once finalised.</p>
